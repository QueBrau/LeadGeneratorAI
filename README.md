## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LeadGeneratorAI.git
cd LeadGeneratorAI
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# or
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Required API Key
1. **OpenAI API Key**: [Get it here](https://platform.openai.com/) - Create account and get API key

### Optional API Keys (for better results)
2. **Google Custom Search API** (FREE - 100 searches/day):
   - Go to [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable "Custom Search API"
   - Create credentials (API key)
   - Set up a Custom Search Engine at [cse.google.com](https://cse.google.com/)
   - Get your Search Engine ID

### Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
# Copy the example and add your keys
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` file with your API keys:
```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Optional (for Google search - otherwise uses direct Reddit API)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_custom_search_engine_id_here

# Configuration
LOCATION=Your City, State
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

3. Customize the search terms in `lead_finder.py` as needed.

## How It Works (Free Approach)

### Search Methods (in order of preference):
1. **Google Custom Search API** (if configured) - 100 free searches/day
2. **Direct Reddit API** - Unlimited, no authentication required
3. **Facebook Groups** - Requires manual checking (API restrictions)

### Without Any API Keys:
- The tool will automatically fall back to Reddit's public JSON API
- You'll get Reddit results without any API limits
- Facebook search will show setup instructions

### With Google Custom Search (Recommended):
- Get 100 free Google searches per day
- Much broader coverage including all platforms
- More comprehensive results

## Usage

Run the lead finder:
```bash
python lead_finder.py
```

The tool will:
1. Search for relevant posts across multiple platforms
2. Analyze each post using AI to determine if it's a qualified lead
3. Save qualified leads to `qualified_leads.csv`

## Output

The generated CSV file contains:
- Platform (Facebook, Reddit, Nextdoor)
- Post title/content
- URL (when available)
- AI analysis and reasoning
- Lead quality score
